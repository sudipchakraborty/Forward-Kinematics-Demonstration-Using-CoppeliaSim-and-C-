# Forward-Kinematics-Demonstration-Using-CoppeliaSim-and-C-
Robot researchers need the simulator to test their functions and algorithm before implementing into the real robot. Most of the time, a customizable Robot simulator is not available to the researcher. Some good options are available in the market, but their price is too high, not affordable. After much research, we found a better solution around all aspects, fully customizable and entirely free of cost. There are two sides. One is a 3D view of robotics ARM, and another is a joint controller of robotics ARM. For 3D simulation, CoppeliaSim is the best option. It is free of cost and Open Source. The C# language is becoming famous for its managed code structure and ease of implementation. Our Robot controller is in the C# language. For control and debug we use Microsoft visual studio 2019. It is an unparallel IDE for the programmer. In the CoppeliaSim little bit, Lua script is in associated functions. Communication Between the simulator and our application, we will use Remote API Framework.
